# About me
---

I am a Research Associate Professor at Northeastern University, [Roux Institute](https://roux.northeastern.edu/) member, and Core Faculty at the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/). My research lies at the intersection between network science, data science, epidemiology, economics, and artificial intelligence. My most recent work focuses on developing large-scale, data-driven computational models to study and forecast the spatial spread of infectious diseases while considering the impact of changes in human behavior (e.g. mobility, contact patterns, vaccine hesitancy, ..) and policy interventions. 

My research interests include: a) the development of computational and analytical models to study and forecast the spatial spread of infectious diseases; b) the development of agent-based models to create realistic representations of population dynamics; c) the study of human mobility and contact patterns using high-resolution large-scale de-identified location data; d) the development of computational frameworks that combine mechanistic epidemic models with machine learning/deep learning models; and e) the study of the evolution and structure of science and innovation.
