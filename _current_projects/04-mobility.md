The COVID-19 pandemic offers an unprecedented natural experiment providing insights into collective behavioral changes of both exogenous (government mandated) and endogenous (spontaneous reaction to infection risks) origin. In this project we characterize collective physical distancing---mobility reductions, minimization of contacts, shortening of contact duration---in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing de-identified location data for a panel of over 5.5 million anonymized, opted-in U.S. devices. We define several indicators of users’ mobility and proximity to investigate deviations from typical pre-pandemic activity and we show the statistical association of such indicators with new deaths at a time lag that is consistent with CDC estimates. By early autumn 2020, people in the U.S. have reshaped their behavior into a new (physically distanced) normal. In this project we provide a framework to study massive social distancing phenomena with potential uses in analyzing and monitoring the effects of pandemic mitigation plans at the national and international level.
