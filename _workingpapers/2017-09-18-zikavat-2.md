# Abstract
Numerous Zika virus vaccines are being developed. However, identifying sites to evaluate the
efficacy of a Zika virus vaccine is challenging due to the general decrease in Zika virus activity.
We compare results from three different modeling approaches to estimate areas that may have
increased relative risk of Zika virus transmission during 2017. The analysis focused on eight
priority countries (i.e., Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico,
Panama, and Peru). The models projected low incidence rates during 2017 for all locations in the
priority countries but identified several subnational areas that may have increased relative risk of
Zika virus transmission in 2017. Given the projected low incidence of disease, the total number
of participants, number of study sites, or duration of study follow-up may need to be increased to
meet the efficacy study endpoints.
